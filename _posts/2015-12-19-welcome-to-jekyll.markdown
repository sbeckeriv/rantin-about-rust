It's my first github jektll site so expect the worse.

Since 2006 I have been writing Ruby professionally. Something about rust
caught my eye and I started out on a journey of learning.

I have two (hopefully unused) crates. [smith_waterman] for an algorithm
of the same name. I found it on a wiki page and thought it would be a
nice start. Also [warc_parser] for WebARChive files. One day I will
crawl the internet with rust.

I recently picked up Algorithms by Sedgewick in an effort to give me
some guidelines in my learning. You can check out the [Github code].
